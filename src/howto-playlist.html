    <h1>How-To Make a Playlist</h1>

    <p>This guide shows you how to make your own playlist for the <em>2AMetronome</em> app.</p>

    <p>To keep things simple (for me as the programmer) the app offers no functionality
      to create or manage a playlist. Instead it relies on a simple text file in the JSON 
      format. JSON may be already familiar to you, but if not: don't worry. It is easy to learn.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Playlist</h2>

    <p>Here you see an example for a playlist file:</p>

    <pre>
{
  "title": "Demo Playlist",
  "songs": [
    {
      "title": "Echoes of Tomorrow",
      "bpm": 128,
      "duration": "3:26"
    },
    {
      "title": "Dancing Shadows",
      "bpm": 165,
      "autoStop": 10,
      "duration": "2:35"
    },
    {
      "title": "Silent Symphony",
      "bpm": 72,
      "autoSilence": 10,
      "duration": "3:31"
    }
  ]
}
    </pre>
    <div class="code-caption">my-playlist.json</div>

    <p>You could start a simple text editor, like <em>Notepad</em> on a Windows PC, copy the contents above 
      into the notepad and save the file as <em>my-playlist.json</em> - et voil√†: you have made a valid 
      playlist to load into the 2AMetronome app.</p>

    <p>It is important to use a text application (like Notepad) and not a word processor (like Word), 
      since a plain text file is required. You can also use online text editors like 
      <a href="https://jsoneditoronline.org/classic/" target="_blank">JSON Editor Online</a>.</p>

    <p>How the JSON format works is explained in detail 
      <a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/json-in-plain-english-a59fe38c9bea" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>However, to make a playlist you don't have to read the manual. Let's have a look at the example
      above and see what's in the file. The playlist has a <span class="keyword">title</span>, which is "Demo Playlist". 
      It defines a list (or an array) with three songs. The list starts with a <span class="keyword">[</span> character 
      and ends with a <span class="keyword">]</span> character. Every song in the list is followed by a comma    
      <span class="keyword">,</span> character - except the last one.
    </p>

    <h2>Song properties</h2>

    <p>Each song requires at least these two properties: <span class="keyword">title</span> and 
      <span class="keyword">bpm</span>. Note that every property (the word on the left side of the colon 
      <span class="keyword">:</span>) in the file must start and end with a double quote <span class="keyword">"</span>. 
      The following properties are optional, here's what they do:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="keyword">duration</span>: Format: m:ss (minutes:seconds), the play time of the song. 2AMetronome 
          sums the duration of each song and shows the overall playtime of your playlist.
        </li>
        <li><span class="keyword">autoStop</span>: number of bars. 2AMetronome stops automatically after that number of 
          bars.</li>
        <li><span class="keyword">autoSilence</span>: number of bars. 2AMetronome makes no more noises after that number 
          of bars but continues to blink, to give you visual feedback.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Load a Playlist on a Smartphone</h2>

    <p>In case you wonder how to load your playlist file on a smartphone: you could send the file
      by e-mail, or with a messenger app to your smartphone. On your smartphone, store the playlist 
      file on the file system (for instance in the <em>Download</em> folder). Or you could store the 
      file in Google Drive, Dropbox or another cloud file storage, and choose the file from that location.
